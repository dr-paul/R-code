#MULTIPLE CORRESPONDENCE ANALYSIS
 
 #a useful methodology (1) to see what constructs are associated with brands (i.e. who owns which attributes in the competitive space), (2) to identify patterns of behaviour/ product usage (i.e. do consumers with different products use them the same way?), and (3) segmentation - preferences among groups and/or complimentary products
 
 #THIS CODE IS WRITTEN TO RUN ON WINDOWS
 
 #process/ notes
 1. "rubbish in, rubbish out" - need to be careful with the quality of data as there are no diagnostics to check the results
 2. the data file should already be cut to the group of people you want to investigate (i.e. csv file has only 30-35 year old respondents)
 3. all the data should be TEXT (as single words, not sentences), like so:
  ID    BRAND   BRANDING    SERVICE
  001   MBV     Novel       Convenient
  002   MBV     Trendy      Delays
  003   Toyota  Friendly    Convenient
 4. where the code says "vars = data[,c("VAR1","VAR2",...etc" this is telling R to select the following variables to analyse
 5. change these to the variable names in the csv file (one needs to be the brand variable if you want to see the relation between brand and attribtues)
 6. run the code in R
 7. R should generate a perceptual map which serves as a guide to the final chart mainly because it is not fixed (i.e. 0,0 coordinates are not in the middle and the length on either side of the 0 for each axis is not equal)
 8. of all the output, there is only one table of interest which appears directly below "mca1$var$coord"
 9. and from that table, only the first two dimensions contain the x and y coordinates: dim 1 = x-axis, dim 2 = y-axis
 10. in Google Slides (or PowerPoint or Keynote), select the X Y Scatter chart, add the x and y axis values and adjust the chart axes so they have the same length (i.e. -5 to 5) - makes 0,0 position in the middle of the chart
 
 #Step 0: load required packages
 
 require(FactoMineR)
 require(ggplot2)
 
 #load data
 
 data <- read.csv("C:/.../Data/File Name.csv", header=TRUE)
 
 #Step 1: specify the variables for MCA (all must be binary variables)

 vars = data[,c("VAR1", "VAR2", "VAR3")]

 #number of categories per variable
 
 cats = apply(vars, 2, function(x) nlevels(as.factor(x)))

 #Step 2: run the analysis
 
 #apply MCA
 
 mca1 = MCA(vars, graph=FALSE)

 #eignevalue table
 
 mca1$eig
 
 #column coordinates
 
 mca1$var$coord
 
 #row coordinates

 #data frames for ggplot
 
 mca1_vars_df = data.frame(mca1$var$coord, Variable=rep(names(cats), cats))
 mca1_obs_df = data.frame(mca1$ind$coord)

 #plot of variable categories
