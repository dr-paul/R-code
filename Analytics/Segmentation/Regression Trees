#RECURSIVE PARTITIONING OF REGRESSION TREES

#a way to develop and test whether variables are useful to segment a group of people
#this process creates a decision tree that tries to correctly classify people by splitting them into significant groups
#it is 'recursive' because each group can be split infinitely until (a) no more significant differences exist, and (b) the group of people is smaller than 30 (too small for a segment)
#a better way to do segmentation than cluster analysis

#THIS CODE IS WRITTEN TO RUN ON A MAC

#process
#1) each row in the dataset must be info for 1 person
#2) all the variables must be categorical (i.e. age, gender, location, purchase model, brochure download Y/N)
#3) define your variables of interest
#4) the output of "analysis" should tell you the number of people and the proportion

#Step 0: load required packages

library(rpart)
library(partykit)

#load data

inputdata <- read.csv("/Users/.../data/File Name.csv", header=TRUE)
str(inputdata)

#select a subset of the data if needed

inputdata <- subset(inputdata, select=c(DV, IV1, IV2, IV3))
str(inputdata)

#Step 1: specify the model
#minsplit=30 means the node must have at least 30 people before attempting to split it
#minbucket=30 means that the split groups must have at least 30 people in them otherwise leave as is

analysis <- rpart(DV ~ IV1 + IV2, data=inputdata, model=TRUE, control=rpart.control(minsplit=30, minbucket=30))

#Step 2: plot and save

diagram <- as.party(analysis)
png('/Users/.../data/diagram.png')
plot(diagram)
dev.off()
